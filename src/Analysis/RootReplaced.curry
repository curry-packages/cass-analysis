--- RootReplaced analysis:
--- This analysis returns for each function f all functions to which this can
--- be replaced at the root. For instance, if there are the definitions:
---
---     f x = g x
---     g x = h x
---     h x = k x : []
---
--- then the root replacements of f are [g,h].
---
--- This analysis could be useful to detect simple loops, e.g., if
--- a function is in its root replacement. This is the purpose
--- of the analysis `RootCyclic` which assigns `True` to some
--- operation if this operation might cause a cyclic root replacement.

--- Data type to represent root replacement information.
--- Basically, it is the set (represented as a sorted list) of
--- all function names to which a function can be replaced (directly
--- or by several steps) at the root
--- together with a list of arguments (which are numbered from 0)
--- which might be projected into the result.
--- The latter is necessary to compute the root replacement
--- information for definitions like `look = id loop`.
